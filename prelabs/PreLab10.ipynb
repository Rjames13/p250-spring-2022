    "\n",
    "We have introduced the $\\chi^2$ and will use it to fit for parameters of a model given some data, but what is it really? We know that given some data represented by the values $y_i$ and uncertainties $\\sigma_i$ when evaluated at some points $x_i$ we can fit for the parameters, $\\vec p$, of a model $f(x, \\vec p)$. Even if $f(x, \\vec p)$ is a linear function of the parameters, $\\vec p$, when there are more data points, $\\vec y$, than there are parameters, $\\vec p$, there will **not be a unique solution** for $\\vec p$. Instead we look for a set of parameters such that the curve described by the model is \"close\" to the data. Many choices could be made to define what \"close\" means. The one we make when performing least squares fitting is to minimize the $\\chi^2$ defined by\n",

    "\n",
    "The $\\chi^2$ is useful even without performing a fit. Since it gives a measure of the \"distance\" between the data and a model, it can be used to quantify how \"good a fit\" the model is to the data. Unfortunately this *is* the way it is phrased. We talk about \"goodness of fit\" even when the $\\chi^2$ is not minimized in order to find the best fit parameters. In other words, the $\\chi^2$ can be used to perform model comparisons. When we speak of the \"goodness of fit\" we mean the probability that the $\\chi^2$ would exceed the value calculated by chance for the number of degrees. In statistics this is referred to as a one-sided $p$-value. We will continue to call it the goodness of fit, but it is perhaps better to think of it as a $p$-value.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get some practice and gain more familiarity with the $\\chi^2$ we will generate some fake data and analyze it. You should think about each of the comparisons performed below to develop some intuition of what to look for in plots of data. Essentially we want to gain some experience in performing \"chi by eye\", this means to get a rough idea of how well a model agrees with the data just by looking at plots.

    "### What did we just learn?\n",
    "\n",
    "The calculations performed above are nice, but what do we learn from them? The answer is somewhat subtle; such is the nature of statistics. Since we are using random data, some of the small details of the calculations can change. It is worthwhile to rerun the calculations for a few different data sets to see which results change and which do not. (If you do this, make sure you leave your notebook in a state where all the calculations have been run for the same set of random data.) We should find that the $\\chi^2$ and goodness of fit for a model using the true parameters varies, perhaps even significantly. On the other hand, doubling the error bars always leads to a goodness of fit extremely close to one and halving the error bars always leads to a very small goodness of fit. Finally, the best fit parameters will not be the true values but will always be close (usually within 2 or 3 times the uncertainty in the parameters), the $\\chi^2$ will be smaller than that from the model with the known parameters, but the goodness of fit will sometimes be smaller and sometimes be larger.\n",
    "\n",
    "This last point may seem strange. How can it be that we have the best fit parameters and yet the goodness of fit be worse? The important point is that **when we perform a statistical calculation we are answering a specific question**. We must clearly understand the question we are asking before we can interpret the results. Further, if we ask a different question we will get a different answer and it is often difficult to know how to compare the results from two different statistical calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the calculations performed here we have asked two different questions. In the first case we had a fixed model with **no free parameters**. Here we were asking how close is the data to a particular model with particular values for the parameters. In the second case we had a model with two parameters which could be optimized to find the values that best reproduce the data (best in the least squares sense). Here we were asking for the best fit values of the parameters in our model given the data. The \"fitting\" performed used some of the information in the data points to tune the values of the parameters, thus all of the data points were no longer independent pieces of information. Since we were asking different questions it is not surprising that trying to compare the values for the goodness of fit between the two cases can be confusing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Turning this around, comparing different cases such as we have here can be used to address the question of whether the data justifies (or needs) a more complicated model. Do we need to add more parameters to the model and fit for their best values? If adding more parameters does not increase the goodness of fit then we are not justified in adding them."
