    "\n",
    "Why are we being so insistent that notebooks should be written in specific ways, enforcing all sorts of \"rules\" on what you do?  There are a number of reasons that could be given, but, in the end, they reduce to this being the right way to create sustainable documents.  In research it is often the case that we need to revisit calculations performed months or even years earlier.  This could be due to a referee's comment on a paper suggesting some small change to try or it could be that we are working on a similar project and want to reuse code from the past.  In this course it could be that you need to look back at the labs while working on the computational portion of the midterm or final exams!  In such cases we typically will have forgotten the details of what we had been working on and instead only have the code sitting there.  Notebooks make it much easier to leave this code in a documented, usable form.  Even so, if we have implicitly made assumptions about the environment in which the code will be run, these assumptions will have been long since forgotten when we come back to the code, and thus we would need to spend a lot of time trying to figure out \"what we were thinking\" at the time.  If instead we are explicit about all these details it will be much easier to figure out what the code is doing and how to use/reuse it.\n",
