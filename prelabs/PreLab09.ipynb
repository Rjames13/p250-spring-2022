    "\n",
    "In the lab this week we will solve the time independent Schrödinger equation in one dimension for two different potentials.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, much of quantum mechanics reduces to solving eigenvalue problems.  We have probably encountered the time independent Schrödinger equation in modern physics.  In its tersest form it may be written as $\\hat H \\psi(x)=E\\psi(x)$.  Here $\\hat H$ is the Hamiltonian operator which we will have more to say about, $E$ is the energy of the system, and $\\psi(x)$ is the wave function which encodes the information about the state of the system.  The Hamiltonian is determined from the physics, so, given a Hamiltonian, our goal is to solve for the energy and the wave function.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we first study quantum mechanics we typically write the Hamiltonian as a differential operator.  For a single particle in one dimension the nonrelativistic Hamiltonian may be written as\n",
    "$$\\hat H = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2}{\\mathrm{d}x^2}+V(x).$$\n",
    "Here $\\hbar=h/2\\pi$ is the reduced Planck constant and $V(x)$ is the potential energy (though we will just refer to it as a potential).  It is convenient to work in units of $\\hbar$ and $m$ meaning that they get absorbed into the energies.  In this case the Schrödinger equation becomes\n",
    "$$ -\\frac12 \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 \\psi(x)}{\\mathrm{d}x^2}+V(x)\\psi(x)=E\\psi(x).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In a quantum mechanics course we solve this equation for various choices of the potential energy.  To solve it numerically we can proceed in a number of ways.  One is to use a differential equation integrator, such as `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp`, to do the work for us.  (Since this is such an important equation, specialized integrators have been developed which would be even better to use.)  **An alternative approach** is to instead turn it into a matrix equation and solve it as an eigenvalue problem.\n",

    "Note that here $h$ is the step size and **has nothing to do with Planck’s constant**.  Despite the fact that this algorithm is only accurate to order $h^2$ it will be sufficient for our purposes.  With this we can rewrite the Schrödinger equation in matrix form\n",

    "\n",
    "We need to understand the linear system we just wrote down. The approach we will use and the structure we will find is very similar to that from PreLab 08.  To this end it is best to again grab some paper in order to work out some of the details.  We are again solving a one dimensional system in a region of length $L$ along the $x$-axis.  To do so, we discretize the wave function by evaluating it at $N+1$ points. Further, we will take these points to be equally spaced with step size $h$ along the $x$-axis so that $\\psi_j \\equiv \\psi(x_j)$ with $x_j = x_0 + j h$.  With this and the discretized form of the second derivative we can rewrite $\\hat H \\psi(x)$ in the discrete (matrix) form $\\mathsf{H}\\vec \\psi$.  Use this to find the form of $\\mathsf{H}$.  You should find it is a symmetric tridiagonal matrix."

    "Now that we know $\\mathsf{H}$ we can solve the eigenvalue problem $\\mathsf{H}\\vec\\psi = E\\vec\\psi$ for $E$ and $\\psi$.  Since $\\mathsf{H}$ is a tridiagonal matrix it is again best to use a specialized function for this case.  Thus instead of using `scipy.linalg.eig` or `scipy.linalg.eigh` we will use `scipy.linalg.eig_banded`.  Look up its documentation.  You should see it is similar to what we encountered in the previous Lab except that it **requires a symmetric banded matrix**.  Fortunately that is exactly what we have.  In fact, this function is more similar to `scipy.linalg.solveh_banded`. \n",

    "It is easiest to use the function in its default configuration.  This means it will return both the eigenvalues and eigenvectors for $\\mathsf{H}$ given the **upper** part of the matrix.  Once again study the documentation and pay particular attention to the *upper form* in the example.  There they show an example of a $6\\times6$ matrix with 5 \"diagonals\" (2 upper and 2 lower bands along with the main diagonal.)"

To determine this it is simplest to discretize the integral condition from quantum mechanics.

In other word, solving the eigenvalue problem gives us a vector, let us call it $\\vec\\psi^{(\\mathrm{ev})}$, that satisfies $|\\vec\\psi^{(\\mathrm{ev})}|^2=1$.
