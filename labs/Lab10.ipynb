Though a common assumption made, it is arguably not a statistically valid choice. See the end of the lab for more discussion.) The equations provided here are only valid for a flat universe.

    "\n",
    "To proceed, we will need to implement the equations given above. I recommend you define each of the previous relationships as a separate function. There are a few things to keep in mind when doing so.\n",
    "1. In the distance modulus the logarithm is base 10, not the natural logarithm. Recall that `np.log()` returns the natural logarithm.\n",
    "2. If you define each of the above relationships in the \"usual\" way they will work for an array of redshift values, $z$, **except for the luminosity distance** due to the integral. For this reason I recommend defining a function `dl(z,Omega_de,w=-1.,h=0.7)` as given by the relationship above, then use `np.vectorize` to construct `DL`, as discussed in the prelab. Notice the order I have chosen for the arguments and the default values. This will be useful below and all your functions should be defined in a similar way.\n",
    "3. Since we are integrating $1/E(z,\\Omega_{\\mathrm{de}},w)$ it makes sense to define a function that returns this inverted quantity instead of just $E(z,\\Omega_{\\mathrm{de}},w)$.\n",

    "## A Flat Universe?\n",
    "\n",
    "Does it make sense to assume the Universe is flat, that is, can we fix $\\Omega=1$? It is something that is typically done. In fact, the \"standard cosmological model\" is a 6 parameter model that assumes a flat Universe! Despite this, forcing $\\Omega=1$ is a questionable action. Although topology can provide models that must be flat (certain topologies only allow for flat spacetimes), even in these cases we do not expect our observations over a finite region of the Universe to exactly have $\\Omega=1$. It would only be exactly flat if we could measure the entire Universe. Thus it makes much more sense to also keep $\\Omega$ as a free parameter in our fit. This can be done in a way similar to what we have done in this lab; it requires known modifications to the equations we have used. Interestingly, when doing so with CMB data from Planck, the preferred value of the Hubble constant comes out even lower!"
